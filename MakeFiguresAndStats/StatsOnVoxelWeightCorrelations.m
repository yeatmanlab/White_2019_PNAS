%% function StatsOnVoxelWeightCorrelations
% Printing statistics for White, Palmer, Boynton & Yeatman, PNAS 2019. 
% This function analyzes the correlations between single voxel responses to
% words on the left and right. It also examines the standard deviation of the differences 
% between respones to words on the left and right. 
% This is a control analysis to address the concern that left VWFA-2
% appears to lack 2 channels only because of lower SNR of our measurements.

% In more detail: 
% For each ROI in each subject, take the correlation across voxels of
% response to single word (L) on the left vs response to single words on the
% right (R). 
% 
% The one-channel model is that L = aR + noise
% The two-channel model is that L = aR + reliableDifference + noise
%    where "a" is some scalar difference reflecting mean hemifield asymmetry 
%
% So corr(L,R) must be lower for the two-channel model than the one-channel
% model
